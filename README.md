# Hello there 👋
## I’m José Navarro, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in education and a love for technology and sports.

🔭 I’m currently working on **PadelZone**, a project focused on creating an innovative platform for padel club owners.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about **React** and **APIs REST** to build scalable and efficient web applications.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or innovative tech solutions that challenge my skills and creativity.

🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced **backend optimization techniques** and **cloud-based deployments**.

💬 Ask me about Full-Stack development, **APIs REST**, or how to combine education and technology to create impactful solutions.

😄 **Pronouns**: He/him

⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m an enthusiast of coding and sports—two sides of the same coin. Both require discipline, focus, and teamwork. However, while in sports success is measured in seconds or points, in coding it’s measured in efficient solutions and clean lines of code. I’m equally passionate about both! 🏋️‍♂️💻
