⚡ Fun fact: I’m an enthusiast of coding and sports—two sides of the same coin. Both require discipline, focus, and teamwork. However, while in sports success is measured in seconds or points, in coding it’s measured in efficient solutions and clean lines of code. I’m equally passionate about both! 🏋️‍♂️💻
